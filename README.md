# TM915_RFID_Reader

Arduino sketches for JOGTEK's [TM915](http://jogtek.com/) family of RFID readers. The RFID reader works at 902-928 MHz in the US (other frequncy bands for Europe and Asia are selectable). The reader interfaces with any Arduino-programmable MCU via UART and the AT-like command set allows full configuration  of reader frequency range, RX power, and reading and writing up to 32 words of user data from/to the tags. The v.02 can read inexpensive tags at a maximum range of ~ 1 meter, the v.03 out to 3 meters, and the v.05 out to 5 meters. All can read a limited number of tags with unique IDs simultaneously while the v.05 can read an almost unlimited number simultaneously. Really quite impressive technology with a lot of applications in the indusrial and inventory management space.
